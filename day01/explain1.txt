Explaining Each Case in the Interaction
ðŸ”¹ Case 1: If Flag == "Replace"

If value of Flag equals "Replace"
   Set Text (Text Field) to "[[This.text]]"
   Set Variable Value Flag to "Join"

ðŸ‘‰ What happens here?
If Flag == "Replace", it means the display should be cleared before showing a new value.
The current button's text ([[This.text]]) is set as the new display value (replacing the old value).
Then, the Flag is set to "Join", meaning that the next input should be appended instead of replacing.

ðŸ›  Example

Display shows "0", and Flag = "Replace".
You press 7:
The display is updated to "7" (replacing "0").
Flag is now "Join".

ðŸ”¹ Case 2: If Flag == "Join"

plaintext
CopyEdit
Else If value of Flag equals "Join"
   Set Text (Text Field) to "[[Target.text]][[This.text]]"

ðŸ‘‰ What happens here?
If Flag == "Join", it means that the new button press should append the number instead of replacing.
The existing display value ([[Target.text]]) is combined with the new button value ([[This.text]]).
ðŸ›  Example

Display shows "7", and Flag = "Join".
You press 5:
The display updates to "75" (appending 5 instead of replacing).
Flag remains "Join".
